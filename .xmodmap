! Escape and Control keys historically belong on the left side, right
! next to the "A" key in the home row. Nowadays they have drifted away
! from the home row, which adds wear and tear to your fingers and steals
! valuable time.
!
! To get back to this key layout, I've remapped, on my IBM PC compatible 
! keyboard, the Caps Lock key to Control, and the Tab key to Escape.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! Set the right Windows key to be a modifier key (control)
!
!keycode 116 = Control_R
!add Control = Control_R
!!the above doesn't work on Ubuntu 13... but the below does:
xmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = Control_L'
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! make Caps Lock physical key into the Control logical key
!
clear Lock
!    ‘‘clear Lock’’ will remove all any keys that were bound to  the
!    shift lock modifier.
!
add control = Caps_Lock
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! Swap the Escape and Tab keys
!
keycode 23 = Escape
keycode 9 = Tab
!
! note: use "xev" to get keycodes for physical keys
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

! note: I physically removed my left control key (in the botom left of my keyboard)
!       to break my muscle memory habit of using it, and to get used to using the
!       former Caps Lock key instead.


! note: use "xmodmap -e '...'" to run an xmodmap command from the command line
